    An array of RTL-SDR SDRs, used by a client



Installation
============

1. ``git clone https://github.com/gammarf/gammarf``

2. Adjust gammarf.conf.  Set ``station_id`` and ``station_pass`` to what you registered on the server's signup page.

3. ``./prepare; ./run.sh``.  This assumes Docker is installed and running.  You can save CPU / memory by doing this
   without Docker, but you'll need to install packages manually.

4. If you're using a HackRF (necessary for most functionality), flash the rom with the newest firmware version, and use the latest libraries.  This is a must!

5. Make sure all clients are running time synchronization services (ntpd, timesyncd)


Configuration
=============

Below is an example configuration file::

    [modules]
    modules = scanner, adsb, freqwatch, remotetask, p25rx, snapshot, tdoa, ism433, single

    [connector]
    station_id = demo
    station_pass = demo1234
    server_host = gammarf.io
    data_port = 9090
    cmd_port = 9091
    server_web_proto = https
    server_web_port = 8080

    [startup]
    startup_1010 = adsb
    startup_9000 = p25rx 50000
    startup_virtual = scanner, freqwatch

    [location]
    usegps = 0
    lat = 39.04
    lng = -94.6

    [scanner]
    # squelch (above avg.) for interesting freqs, must be float
    hit_db = 15.0

    [rtldevs]
    rtl_path = /usr/local/bin

    gain_1000 = 23
    ppm_1000 = 0
    offset_1000 = 0
    range_1000 = 30 1600

    #gain_1001 = 23
    ppm_1001 = 0
    offset_1001 = 0
    range_1001 = 30 1600

    gain_1007 = 23
    ppm_1007 = 0
    offset_1007 = 0
    range_1007 = 30 1600

    gain_1008 = 23
    ppm_1008 = 0
    offset_1008 = 0
    range_1008 = 30 1600

    [hackrfdevs]
    hackrf_path = /usr/local/bin
    lna_gain = 32
    vga_gain = 40


Configuration Sections
----------------------

    1. ``[modules]``
           This section contains a single setting, *modules*, which is the
           list of modules to be loaded by the client.  It's alright
           to leave this alone, even if you don't plan on using every module.

    2. ``[connector]``
           This section contains information about the station and server.  The station ID
           and password must have already been registered with the server.

    3. ``[startup]``
           Modules can be loaded at client start using this section. The format of entries is:

           ``startup_{device} = {module} {parameters}``

           Device numbers 9000+ are for pseudo-devices (currently only `p25rx`).  If the device
           number is instead the string `virtual`, the module will be assigned to the HackRF,
           if one is present.  Only particular modules are able to run on the HackRF.

           For RTL-SDR devices, the device number is the serial number.  This can be set with the
           `rtl_eeprom` utility.

    4. ``[location]``
           If ``usegps`` is set to 0, the ``lat`` and ``lng`` settings will be used to determine node
           position.  The coordinates should be in decimal degrees.  If ``usegps`` is 1, then gpsd
           on the local system will be used to determine the node's location.  You will want to use GPS
           if your node moves around.

    5. ``[scanner]``
           This section holds scanner module settings.

    6. ``[rtldevs]``
           The *rtl_path* setting tells the client where the RTL-SDR tools,
           (such as ``rtl_power``) are installed.  *gain_{device}* defines the
           gain of device *X*.  *ppm_{device}* defines the ppm (error) value for
           device *X*.  *offset_{device}* assigns a frequency offset (in MHz)to
           the device.  You might set the offset when using an upconverter.
           Finally, *range{device}* specifies the frequency range the device
           supports, minimum and maximum in MHz.

    10. ``[hackrfdevs]``
            Binary path and gain information for HackRF devices.


Usage
=====

The client will identify any available RTL-SDR devices, and the first HackRF.  You will be presented with a prompt.  Use the below command reference to get started (tab completion is available).

    * ``devs``: Show loaded devices and running modules.  Time is UTC

    * ``help``: Show available commands

    * ``interesting_add``: Add an entry to the station's 'interesting' list

    * ``interesting_clone``: CLone interesting frequencies from another station

    * ``interesting_del``: Remove an entry from the station's 'interesting' list

    * ``interesting``: Show the station's current 'interesting' list

    * ``location``: Show the location the client currently thinks it is at

    * ``message``: Send a messager to another node.  If the node is not logged
      in when the message is sent, the message will be retrieved when it logs
      in.  ``> message [target] [message]``

    * ``mods``: List available modules and show their usage information

    * ``now``: Show the current date and time, according to the node (UTC)

    * ``p25_add``: Add an entry to the station's list of p25 talkgroups

    * ``p25_del``: Remove an entry from the station's list of p25 talkgroups

    * ``p25``: Show the station's current list of p25 talkgroups

    * ``pwr``: Show power at a frequency (requires HackRF)

    * ``quit``: Exit the client

    * ``remotetask``: Request a module to be run on another node (the node must
      be listening for requests of this type)

    * ``reserve``: Reserve a device

    * ``run``: Run a module.  Module arguments can be seen in the module's
      section in the output of the ``mods`` command

    * ``settings``: Show / toggle a module's settings.  Each module may have its
      own settings.  Settings are shown in the output of the ``mods`` command,
      or can be seen by typing ``settings {module}``.  Settings are toggled
      by typing ``settings {module} {setting-name} {value}``.  In the case
      of boolean settings, ``{value}`` is omitted

    * ``stop``: Stop a job.  The device index is used in conjunction with this
      command, e.g. ``stop 1``.  The device will be available for use with
      another module (or another instance of the same module) after ``stop``
      has been run on it.  For modules that run on the HackRF, the device
      'numbers' are letters that are reclaimed when the module finishes running.

    * ``unreserve``: Unreserve a device that has been reserved with the ``reserve`` command

    * ``stations``: Show stations associated with the cluster

    * ``tdoa``: Request stations to cooperate in a TDOA measurement

Modules
=======

A list of currently implemented modules follows.  See the output of the ``mods``
command for usage instructions.

    * ``adsb``:  Aircraft telemetry (ADS-B) module.  Decodes ADS-B broadcasts
      sent by aircraft.

    * ``freqwatch``:  Report the power of each of the station's 'interesting'
      frequencies periodically.

    * ``p25rx``: A pseudo-module that doesn't do much itself.  It accepts output
      from the `trunk-recorder <https://github.com/robotastic/trunk-recorder/>`_
      ``recorder`` command, piped over a UDP socket and sends summary information
      to the server.

    * ``remotetask``: Accept jobs for a certain type of module from others.

    * ``scanner``: This module receives a list of "interesting" frequencies for
      your node from the server, and monitors their signal levels.  It behaves sort
      of like a handheld radio scanner - it will report frequencies that exceed the
      squelch (a configurable level above the average at that frequency.)  Be
      careful adjusting this module's ``hit_db`` parameter.  If it's too low, noise
      will trigger false hits.  Particularly noisy frequencies may do that, anyway.

    * ``single``: Monitor a single frequency for power above a specified threshold

    * ``snapshot``: Take a picture of a swath of the RF spectrum and send it to
      the server.

    * ``ism433``: Collect and send ISM433 (such as Tire Pressure Monitoring System
      (TPMS) information)


Misc. Considerations
====================

USB Bandwidth
-------------
Use a maximum of four sticks per USB *controller*.  A controller is not
the same thing as a port.  If you start having problems with device errors,
segfaults, or other weird errors, try using less devices per controller.
Give the HackRF its own dedicated USB controller.

Noise
-----
Keep your receivers a good distance from your computer and other electronics.
Keep your antenna(s) by the window.

GPS
---
You should enable GPS in the client configuration if your node will be mobile.
If your node will not be mobile, you can specify static coordinates in the
configuration.  For the sake of accuracy, specify coordinates as accurately as
possible.

``gpsd`` needs to be running and listening on localhost for GPS to work (or, you
can specify an external gpsd server in the configuration.)
`This page <http://www.catb.org/gpsd/installation.html>`_ is helpful for getting
gpsd to work.

Ports
-----
The following ports are used for communications, and should be opened on
the system firewall.

  +-------+----------+--------+-----------+-----------------------------------+
  | Port  | Protocol | In/Out | Bandwidth | Use                               |
  +=======+==========+========+===========+===================================+
  | 8090  | TCP      | Out    | High      | General I/O - to server only      |
  +-------+----------+--------+-----------+-----------------------------------+
  | 8091  | TCP      | Both   | Low       | Command channel                   |
  +-------+----------+--------+-----------+-----------------------------------+

Hardware
--------
Various RTL-SDR vendors exist, and accessories (antennas, amplifiers, filters)
are plentiful.  Here are some tips for picking the right stuff.

* The metal-cased RTL-USB sticks work pretty well.  Look for something with
  a low PPM.

* It's critical to have the right antenna for the job.  If you are scanning
  different frequency bands, have antennas that suit each one.

* Sharing an antenna (through a splitter) results in less power being fed to
  each stick.  One antenna to two sticks, half the power.  And so on.

* If you keep your antenna next to a window, you'll see a big increase in power
  over keeping it far from a window.  If you keep it outside the window, even
  on the outside ledge, you may see a much larger increase.

* For ADS-B, get one of the RTL-SDR dongles specifically made for this (you
  can find them on Amazon); they include an amplifier and filter.  You also
  definitely need an antenna that covers the ADS-B frequency band.

* Keep your sticks far from generators of EM noise, like your PC and monitor.
  Use long USB cables if necessary.  Clamp on ferrite beads to each end of
  the USB cables.

* If you use your sticks with a USB hub, make sure the hub is externally
  powered.
